<h1 align="center">My Study Abroad Trip</h1>
<body bgcolor="#FF9933">
<table> <tr> <td><p><font size="4" color=“000000”> Last Summer, I had the opportunity to travel to several different parts of Australia on a study abroad trip. The flight was very long and took about <b>15</b> hours to get to our first destination Brisbane, Australia.  We spent about a week in Brisbane where we met with several doctors and professors who specialize in skin cancer. Queensland, which is the state Brisbane is located in, is infamously known as the <q>skin cancer capital of the world</q>. We learned about the importance of using several different methods of prevention when being exposed to large amounts of UV radiation. A policy I found very interesting was the school children were required to wear bucket hats when they would go outside for recess to help better protect them. </p>
<p>One of my most memorable experiences from the trip was when we visited a very small and remote island called Lady Elliot. Lady Elliot Island is a coral cay that is located at the southern tip of the Great Barrier Reef. The island is home to some of the best snorkeling and diving in the world. Snorkeling with sea turtles, Manta rays, and reef sharks was the highlight of my experience in Australia and something I will never forget.</p>
<p><em>I would highly recommend students who are thinking about studying abroad to definitely take advantage of the opportunity. It is a great way to earn college credits and experience different cultures and parts of the world!</font></em></p>
